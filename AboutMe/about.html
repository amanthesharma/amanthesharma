      <h1>Hello again, I’m Aman Kumar.</h1>
      <p>
        I’m an engineer-turned-UX designer with a deep passion for crafting intuitive digital experiences. My core skills include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Research & Testing:</strong> Conducting interviews, surveys, and usability tests to uncover real user needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireframing & Prototyping:</strong> Proficient in Figma for creating interactive mockups and high-fidelity prototypes.</li>
        <li><strong>Front-end Development:</strong> Solid grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bridge the gap between design and implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Design Fundamentals:</strong> Strong foundation in typography, color theory, and layout principles.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication & Collaboration:</strong> Comfortable leading design critiques, presenting to stakeholders, and working cross-functionally.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Beyond work, I’m a creative soul with diverse interests. Some of my favorite activities include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drama & Acting:</strong> Performing in local theatre productions and short films—nothing beats the thrill of being on stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Stand-up Comedy & Debate:</strong> Writing my own sets, performing at open-mic nights, and sharpening my critical thinking in friendly debates.</li>
        <li><strong>Dance & Sports:</strong> Practicing contemporary dance routines and staying active through badminton and cricket matches.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Languages:</strong> Currently working on Kannada proficiency—always excited by the challenge of mastering a new tongue.</li>
        <li><strong>Photography & Graphic Art:</strong> Experimenting with street photography in Patna and creating vector illustrations in my free time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Personally, I’m known for being:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Curious & Empathetic:</strong> I love diving into new topics and really listening to people’s stories—this empathy drives every design decision I make.</li>
        <li><strong>Disciplined & Goal-Oriented:</strong> Whether it’s waking up early to practice wireframing or dedicating daily hours to IELTS prep, I stick to my commitments.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptable & Collaborative:</strong> Growing up in a farmer-background family in Patna taught me resourcefulness, and working on cross-functional teams has made me a strong team player.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive & Energetic:</strong> My friends know me as someone who’s always up for a challenge—be it a design sprint or organizing a community event.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Right now, I’m focusing on honing my UX and front-end skills, preparing for a Master’s in User Experience Design, and building connections in the design community. If you share similar interests or have an exciting opportunity, let’s connect!
