    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>Public issue reporting in India remains significantly hindered by inefficiencies, inconveniences, and societal barriers. Motivated by personal experiences of civic negligence—such as illegal parking-induced traffic chaos, animals suffering due to delayed municipal action, and neglected public sanitation—this project proposes an intuitive, unified mobile application designed to address these systemic shortcomings. Features such as real-time geolocation, multimedia evidence uploads, anonymous reporting options, and direct automated notifications significantly enhance citizen participation and responsiveness from government authorities.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="personal">
      <h2>Personal Context & Motivation</h2>
      <p>Having personally experienced the frustration of witnessing unchecked illegal parking leading to prolonged traffic jams and seeing injured animals left without municipal response, the necessity for a proactive civic reporting system became clear. Observing public spaces continuously littered and ignored further strengthened my resolve to develop a solution empowering citizens and enhancing accountability.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="background">
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Active citizen engagement remains pivotal for effective governance. Yet, in India, reporting concerns—from traffic violations and municipal negligence to crimes—remains cumbersome due to lengthy bureaucratic procedures, perceived insignificance of smaller issues, and societal stigma when interacting with authorities.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="problem">
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>A comprehensive and accessible platform for diverse public issue reporting is non-existent, fragmenting efforts and discouraging civic engagement, thereby perpetuating unresolved issues and public dissatisfaction.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="goals">
      <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Develop an intuitive and accessible mobile platform for reporting civic issues.</li>

        <li>Promote transparency, accountability, and citizen empowerment.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="literature">
      <h2>Literature Review</h2>
      <p>Existing mechanisms—manual complaint systems requiring paperwork, fragmented helplines, and regional apps with limited functionality—fail to offer a unified solution. Identified gaps include lack of multi-issue support, usability barriers, and poor feedback mechanisms eroding civic trust.</p>
